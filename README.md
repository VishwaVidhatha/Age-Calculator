Two must things to do :-
- Make entire portion of importing picture code as comment (only if you're not willing to import picture)

- If (you're willing to):
      - Install PIL (Python Image Library in your respective IDE).
      - Refer Youtube for the installation of PIL.
      - Download any image from web and change the path of the file or image in code.
      - Make sure it is in PNG, if not,
          a)convert it to PNG using online converters.
          b)use another functions to import the picture.
          
EFFICIENT WAY COULD BE, SIMPLY DON'T USE IMAGES AND HAVE FUN!
